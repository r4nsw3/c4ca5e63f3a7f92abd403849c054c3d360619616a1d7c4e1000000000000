  |   Girls) to defeat the aliens with their greatest weakness: metal!      |

  |   Just using a single beat won't be enough to rack up the points -      |
  |   showcase a variety of rhythm patterns and earn yourself combo         |
  |   bonuses. Master the art of metal and send those nasty aliens back     |
  |   where they came from!                                                 |
